# xrdp.ini is the default configuration file to set up RDP connections to the xrdp server. The configuration file can be modified and customized to meet the RDP connection requirements.
# In the configuration file, navigate to the Session types section. You will find multiple supported session types and their parameters listed:
sudo nano /etc/xrdp/xrdp.ini

# Now move to your userâ€™s home directory if you are not there already:
cd ~

#create a .xsession file under home folder and add the xfce4-session as the session manager to use upon login:
echo "xfce4-session" | tee .xsession

sudo systemctl restart xrdp

sudo ufw status
